- terraform output ips into ansible inventory, preferably group by cp, worker
- smh change templates/pve-prepare-ubuntu-template.sh so it's compatible with ansible inventory or maybe make an ansible install script for cluster nodes and run logic in ansible idk :D
- decide between kargo or kubespray
    - figure out how to integrate them into the project 
    - configure them
    - adjust spin-up.py
